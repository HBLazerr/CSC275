# Hero Creator â€“ Final Project (C++)

This is an interactive simulation where you can create your own superhero.

You can customize a hero with a name, origin, weapon, suit colors, etc. Users can either choose the hunter class or warlock class. Users can also set a hero to a faction and heroes in the same faction are connected in a graph that can be explored through BFS traversal.

## Features

- Opening prompt with description of application and instructions  
- Menu for the user to choose options  
- Create a hero and input all attributes  
- Choose a class (Hunter or Warlock)  
- Assign heroes to factions  
- Save current heroes to a `.txt` file  
- Load previously saved heroes from file  
- Display all created heroes  
- Sort heroes by level, name, or elimination 
- Search for hero by name
- Explore a heros connections (allies) by faction using BFS traversal  
- Added a default faction list in case user does or has not created one yet

## Object-Oriented Programming

- At least 4 classes total  
- Inheritance (minimum 2 derived classes)  
- Polymorphism (Overloading and overriding)  
- Encapsulation  
- Abstraction  

---

## Data Structures and Techniques

- File input and output processing  
- Vectors  
- Iterators  
- Exception handling  
- Hash table (unordered_map)  
- Graph structure for hero connections  
- Breadth-First Search (BFS) traversal  
- Sorting and searching algorithms

## Notes

My final project is built in C++ using object-oriented programming.  
The app starts with an intro screen and ends with a custom exit screen.  
Hero data is saved and loaded from a text file, including all stats and faction info.  
I used STL containers for flexibility and speed, and added traversal logic for exploring hero connections based on shared factions.  
This project shows how different data structure techniques can be used in an interactive and creative way.
Most listed techniques and OOP are from C++ Programming II final project requirements.
