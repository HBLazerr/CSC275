My final project will be an interactive simulation where you can create your own superhero. 
So far I have created the class and functions for the introduction prompt. I also created 
the class for exiting the program. This is just what I have currently as I am still 
deciding what I fully want to do.

I am planning to use file i/o in order to create a txt document listing all of the users' 
hero's traits like their powers, background stories, name, suit colors, etc.
